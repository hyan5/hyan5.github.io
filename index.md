## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu) and [GMU NLP](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University, advised by [Prof. Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/#Service). 

My research interest is in Natural Language Processing, with a focus on human-AI interaction via natural language. The goal of my research is to facilitate effective and seamless collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence systems including developing interfaces and interaction methods that allow humans to communicate their goals and intentions to AI systems, and receive understandable and desirable responses in return. This also includes studying arising research questions such as ethical issues in machine generations and reinforcement learning with human feedback.



## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
