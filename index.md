## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu) and [GMU NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University, advised by [Prof. Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/#Service). 

My research interest is in Natural Language Processing, with a focus on human-AI interaction via natural language. The goal of my research is to facilitate effective and seamless collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence systems including developing interfaces and interaction methods that allow humans to communicate their goals and intentions to AI systems, and receive understandable and desirable responses in return. This also includes studying arising research questions such as ethical issues in machine generations and reinforcement learning with human feedback.

Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2020 and my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Fujian Normal University in 2017.

In my spare time. I enjoy engaging in various indoor/outdoor activities such as basketball, badminton, swimming, visiting the gym, and hiking. In addition, I really enjoy tasting delicious foods and cooking by myself.
